# Abstract

Achieving realistic simulation of water and specifically ocean waves has been an important research topic in computer graphics and rendering. In this project, we implement the Gerstner Wave function to simulate ocean waves. We have used DirectX for this project. The idea is to create waves with some input parameters to control the behavior. Along with this, we have a wire frame shader to see the movement of the waves in detail.
